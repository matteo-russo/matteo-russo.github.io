<div style="float: right"><b>ABOUT ME</b></div><br><br>

<small>
I'm a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/">University of Nottingham</a>, where I work on <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/utc/research/robotics-for-in-situ-repair/robotics-for-in-situ-repair.aspx">inspection and maintenance robotics</a>. I received an European PhD at the <a href="https://www.unicas.it/">University of Cassino</a>, with research stays at <a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/">Tokyo Institute of Technology</a>, the <a href="https://www.ehu.eus/en/en-home">University of the Basque Country</a> and <a href="https://www.rwth-aachen.de/">RWTH Aachen University</a>. My research addresses the design, kinematic modelling, and optimization of innovative robotic systems, such as continuum robots and cable-driven manipulators.
