<div style="float: right"><b>ABOUT ME</b></div><br><br>

<small>
My research addresses the design, modelling, and optimization of innovative robotic systems. The last decade has been characterized by unprecedented breakthroughs in AI and control systems, which resulted—arguably for the first time ever—in hardware, rather than software, being the bottleneck in robot performance. With my theoretical work, I seek general tools and methods that simplify and improve robot design. On the other hand, my applied research is focused on the development of novel mechatronic solutions for industrial and societal needs. My research interests range from innovative architectures, such as continuum robots and cable-driven manipulators, to the kinematic modelling and optimization of complex mechatronic systems.
