<div style="float: right"><b>ABOUT ME</b></div><br><br>

<small>
I received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Cassino, Italy, in 2013 and 2015, respectively. In 2019, I was awarded a European Doctorate with his Ph.D. in mechanical and biomechanical engineering. I was a visiting researcher at RWTH Aachen University, Germany, at University of the Basque Country, Spain, and at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Since 2019, I have been a Research Fellow at the Rolls-Royce UTC in Manufacturing and On-Wing Technology, University of Nottingham, UK, where I work on inspection and maintenance robotics for the aerospace and nuclear industry.<br><br>
  
My research addresses the design, modelling, and optimization of innovative robotic systems. The last decade has been characterized by unprecedented breakthroughs in AI and control systems, which resulted—arguably for the first time ever—in hardware, rather than software, being the bottleneck in robot performance. With my theoretical work, I seek general tools and methods that simplify and improve robot design. Conversely, my applied research is focused on the development of novel mechatronic solutions for industrial and societal needs. My research interests range from innovative architectures, such as continuum robots and cable-driven manipulators, to the kinematic modelling and optimization of complex mechatronic systems.
