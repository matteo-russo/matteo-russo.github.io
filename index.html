<div style="float: right"><b>ABOUT ME</b></div><br><br>

<small>
I'm a postdoctoral researcher in robotics, currently working on inspection and maintenance robotics at the Rolls-Royce University Techonology Centre in Manufacturing at the University of Nottingham.<br><br>
My research addresses the design, modelling, and optimization of innovative robotic systems. With my theoretical work, I seek general tools and methods that simplify and improve robot design, whereas my applied research focuses on the development of novel mechatronic solutions for industrial and societal needs.<br><br>
My research interests range from innovative mechanical architectures, such as continuum robots and cable-driven manipulators, to the kinematic modelling and optimization of complex mechatronic systems.
